      List of our supply expenses data with basic cleaning and transformation applied.
      One row per supply cost, not per supply. As supply costs fluctuate they receive a new row with a new UUID. Thus there can be multiple rows per supply_id.
    defaults:
      agg_time_dimension:
    entities:
      - name: supply
        type: primary
        expr: supply_id
